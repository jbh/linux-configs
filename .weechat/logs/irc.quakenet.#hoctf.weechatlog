2014-06-29 21:13:01	@Chryyz	Haven't gotten dispatch figured out, but I consolidated file handling.
2014-06-29 21:14:16	@Chryyz	Dokujisan, you work out argparse yet?

2014-06-29 21:25:07	@Chryyz	edong23, he was waiting for you to blow out his candle, so he could blow yours.
2014-06-29 21:25:14	@Dokujisan	there
2014-06-29 21:25:26	@Chryyz	Dokujisan, it confused the fuck out of me.
2014-06-29 21:25:29	@Chryyz	Take a look at it.
2014-06-29 21:25:39	@Chryyz	I wanted to use it for that one irc script I wrote.
2014-06-29 21:33:32	@Dokujisan	Chryyz: what sort of arguments were you wanting to pass to it?
2014-06-29 21:35:44	@Chryyz	https://bitbucket.org/Chryyz/hexchat-scripts/src/af1c5ed460442e2a9add0c3ac1bece2878ecd325/relapsewb.py?at=master
2014-06-29 21:35:48	@Chryyz	'member that?
2014-06-29 21:36:30	@Chryyz	The idea would have been to remove the try statement after the dispatch table
2014-06-29 21:38:12	@Chryyz	The actual dispatch table was CUdyin's contribution I think.
2014-06-29 21:38:38	@Chryyz	Either that or I completely forgot the process of implementing functions in dicts and relearned it a couple days ago. Heh.
2014-06-29 21:46:10	@Dokujisan	oh you haven't added argparse yet
2014-06-29 21:46:30	@Dokujisan	ok
2014-06-29 21:46:41	@Chryyz	Well I won't
2014-06-29 21:46:46	@Chryyz	Because I don't use hexchat anymore.
2014-06-29 21:46:52	@Dokujisan	I was gonna ask what hexchat is
2014-06-29 21:47:13	@Chryyz	But I couldn't add argparse, because it confused me, and I couldn't find any comprehensive guide to writing one
2014-06-29 21:47:17	@Chryyz	Just a bunch of examples.
2014-06-29 21:47:26	@Chryyz	Which didn't work the way I tried to apply them.
2014-06-29 21:47:46	@Chryyz	Hexchat is a fork of XChat2, which is dead.
2014-06-29 21:47:54	@Dokujisan	this has some simple examples.. https://docs.python.org/2/howto/argparse.html
2014-06-29 21:48:15	@Chryyz	Dokujisan, I don't write 2 :P
2014-06-29 21:48:35	@Dokujisan	https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html
2014-06-29 21:48:36	@Dokujisan	:-P
2014-06-29 21:48:37	@Chryyz	ULERNPYTHON3NAOOKAY!?
2014-06-29 21:49:11	@Dokujisan	doesn't look like the tutorial examples changed between 2 and 3
2014-06-29 21:50:04	@Chryyz	Sure they did
2014-06-29 21:50:07	@Chryyz	See this?
2014-06-29 21:50:09	@Chryyz	print("verbosity turned on")
2014-06-29 21:50:34	@Chryyz	    print "verbosity turned on"
2014-06-29 21:50:37	@Chryyz	:O
2014-06-29 21:52:35	@Dokujisan	yeah but not the base functionality
2014-06-29 21:54:50	@Chryyz	Well those examples seem pretty simple.
2014-06-29 21:54:59	@Dokujisan	so I guess you could expand that dispatch table dictionary to include the argument details and then run parser.add_argument() on each
2014-06-29 21:55:12	@Chryyz	Pretty sure I read through all this stuff when I was writing the script and still fucked it anyway.
2014-06-29 21:55:19	@Dokujisan	I imagine that whole try/catch block would be replaced by argparse
2014-06-29 21:55:58	@Chryyz	Dokujisan, that's what it's meant to do
2014-06-29 21:56:11	@Dokujisan	and arg_check()
2014-06-29 21:56:12	@Chryyz	There's another module that handles arguments too
2014-06-29 21:56:38	@Chryyz	optparse
2014-06-29 21:56:41	@Chryyz	And...
2014-06-29 21:56:42	@Dokujisan	ok what are you asking me? I thought you were wanting ideas on implementing it in your existing script
2014-06-29 21:57:29	@Chryyz	And getopt
2014-06-29 21:57:32	@Chryyz	:P
2014-06-29 21:57:41	@Chryyz	I was just asking if you'd messed with it.
2014-06-29 21:57:48	@Chryyz	So I could pick your brain if I needed to.
2014-06-29 21:58:13	@Dokujisan	I haven't
2014-06-29 21:58:16	@Chryyz	CUdyin was kinda like "fuck this shit. you figure it out"
2014-06-29 21:58:21	@Dokujisan	haha
2014-06-29 22:01:44	@Chryyz	Dokujisan, you're in for a treat when you start using threads and butting heads with GIL.
2014-06-29 22:02:01	@Dokujisan	yeah.... hello Golang
2014-06-29 22:03:05	@Chryyz	NO!
2014-06-29 22:03:09	@Dokujisan	haha
2014-06-29 22:03:12	@Chryyz	YOU STICK WITH PYTHON AND FEEL MY PAIN!
2014-06-29 22:03:48	@Chryyz	On a more serious note, the retardation with threads in python is pushing me ever closer to learning C
2014-06-29 22:07:36	@edong23	wtf
2014-06-29 22:07:50	@edong23	yuou are complaining about python and saying you are goign to learn c?

2014-06-29 22:13:10	@Dokujisan	yeah
2014-06-29 22:13:21	@Dokujisan	like 6 months ago or something
2014-06-29 22:15:00	@Chryyz	I was reading an article the other day about how python sites are generally ugly as sin.
2014-06-29 22:15:06	@Chryyz	While Ruby's sites are beautific.
2014-06-29 22:18:10	@Chryyz	Alright
