2014-06-29 20:15:36	+Flynsarmy	http://macdown.uranusjr.com/ great app for us mac users
2014-06-29 20:16:04	+Flynsarmy	would be nice if it had some wysiwyg buttons for those of us who dont know the syntax off by heart
2014-06-29 20:16:23	+Flynsarmy	supports keyboard shortcuts though which is nice
2014-06-29 20:19:19	Eru_	why not just use sublime or atom? both have amazing markdown plugins
2014-06-29 20:19:37	+Flynsarmy	what do you use for md in sublime?
2014-06-29 20:21:44	Eru_	Markdown Preview is a good one, and there's a github flavor. There's also a few for better syntax highlighting
2014-06-29 20:21:56	Eru_	there's a bunch, can't think of them all off the top of my head
2014-06-29 20:22:26	Eru_	There's one that also comes with markdown snippets, as well as a markdown example file with all the syntax of markdown.
2014-06-29 20:27:28	+Flynsarmy	Markdown Preview just has a preview in browser command. i already have a markdown plugin in chrome and tht's how i currently work - drag the md file into the browser then edit it in sublime. every time i hit cmd+s the browser auto updates
2014-06-29 20:27:48	+Flynsarmy	i want it visible in realtime in my editor the way atom does it (though i use sublime)
2014-06-29 20:28:18	Eru_	Flynsarmy: I've converted to atom, so I just use it for everything :P
2014-06-29 20:28:51	+Flynsarmy	does atom have equivalent of 'find symbol in project' that sublime has?
2014-06-29 20:28:59	Eru_	Hmmm sort of
2014-06-29 20:29:12	+Flynsarmy	ie quickly navigating to a class of method of given name anywhere in the project
2014-06-29 20:29:37	Eru_	Flynsarmy: https://atom.io/packages/search?q=symbol
2014-06-29 20:36:31	+Flynsarmy	how do you view the console it atom again?
2014-06-29 20:36:53	+Flynsarmy	i installed symbol-gen and used the generate command but nothing happened. cmd+shift+r is doing nothing
2014-06-29 20:43:22	+Flynsarmy	SamuelGeorges: wonder if october CMS could ever be taken to laracon
2014-06-29 21:08:53	<--	cheddam (~cheddam@office.netvalue.net.nz) has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2014-06-29 21:45:42	+Flynsarmy	do plugins support composer.json?

2014-06-29 23:06:54	+Flynsarmy	blog posts working for you? are blog cats?
2014-06-29 23:07:01	daftspunk1	When a theme is deployed from the server, Flynsarmy.TheMotto, do you prefer: /flynsarmy.themotto , /flynsarmy-themotto or /themotto
2014-06-29 23:07:29	+Flynsarmy	 /themoto
2014-06-29 23:07:32	that0n3guy0	blog post search works... blog cats no... custom search no
2014-06-29 23:07:53	+Flynsarmy	interesting. i wonder if blog cats just has an incorrect search field associated with it. and i'm wondering if yours does too
2014-06-29 23:08:00	daftspunk1	that0n3guy?
2014-06-29 23:08:26	that0n3guy0	sup daftspunk1
2014-06-29 23:08:30	daftspunk1	Hey
2014-06-29 23:08:34	daftspunk1	Preference?
2014-06-29 23:08:44	+Flynsarmy	daftspunk1: is there a way to use composer.json in a plugin? i need to require in some dependencies and autoload a folder from one of them
2014-06-29 23:09:43	that0n3guy0	asking me about the theme thing?  I like to keep it simple w/ /themotto (themotto is the theme name right?)
2014-06-29 23:09:46	daftspunk1	GoogleAnalytics does it
2014-06-29 23:10:13	+Flynsarmy	booya. perfect. thanks!
2014-06-29 23:10:16	daftspunk1	that0n3guy Thanks

2014-06-29 23:12:57	that0n3guy0	so relation column in a list brakes search
